Run-To Feature:

I Implemented the Run To feature, I am unsure exactly of my performance with it.
I utilized Asynchronous programming to implement that feature.

Change HUD Text Color Feature:
I also Implemented the ability to change the color of the HUD Text.

Import Feature:
Additionally, I added the Import feature, and embedded the patterns into the build upon compilation
the Import button should open up directly to the patterns folder.
